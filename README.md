This is a minimal project setup for using TypeScript + Express.

## Usage

Run `yarn` to install dependencies then run `yarn start` to start the server.

## Tests

Run `yarn test` to start the test runner.

## Notes

This project is configured such that modules can be imported using absolute paths. For example: `test/app.test.ts` does `import { createApp } from 'app'` instead of `import { createApp } from '../app'`.
